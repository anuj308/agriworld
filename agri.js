    <span class="titlebold2">About Wheat</span>
    <p class="para">
        Wheat is the main cereal crop in India. The total area under the crop is about 29.8
        million hectares in the country. The production of wheat in the country has increased
        significantly from 75.81 million MT in 2006-07 to an all time record high of 94.88
        million MT in 2011-12. The productivity of wheat which was 2602 kg/hectare in 2004-05
        has increased to 3140 kg/hectare in 2011-12. The major increase in the productivity
        of wheat has been observed in the states of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Higher
        area coverage is reported from MP in recent years.</p>
    <p class="para">
        Indian wheat is largely a soft/medium hard, medium protein, white bread wheat, somewhat
        similar to U.S. hard white wheat. Wheat grown in central and western India is typically
        hard, with high protein and high gluten content. India also produces around 1.0-1.2
        million tons of durum wheat, mostly in the state of Madhya Pradesh. Most Indian
        durum is not marketed separately due to segregation problems in the market yards.
        However, some quantities are purchased by the private trade at a price premium,
        mainly for processing of higher value/branded products.</p>
    <p class="para">
        The production and productivity of Wheat crop were quite low, when India became
        independent in 1947. The production of Wheat was only 6.46 million tonnes and productivity
        was merely 663 kg per hectare during 1950-51, which was not sufficient to feed the
        Indian population. The Country used to import Wheat in large quantities for fulfilling
        the needs of our people from many countries like USA under PL-480. The reasons of
        low production and productivity of Wheat at that time was (a) the tall growing plant
        habit resulting in lodging, when grown under fertile soils, (b) the poor tillering
        and low sink capacity of the varieties used, (c) higher susceptibility to diseases,
        (d) the higher sensitivity to thermo &amp; photo variations, etc., resulting in
        poor adaptability, and (e) longer crop duration resulting in a long exposure of
        plants to the climatic variations and insect pest / disease attacks.</p>
    <p class="para">
        The Government of India appointed a commission in 1961 to assess the feasibility
        of increasing the crop productivity under prevailing Indian ecological conditions.
        As result of various steps taken by Govt. of India, the Wheat scenario in our country
        has completely changed. In the post Independence era, country used to import Wheat
        for our needs but due to bumper increase in the production and productivity of Wheat
        in the 'Green Revolution' period in late sixties, our country became self dependent
        in Wheat production. At present, country is producing much more excess Wheat than
        the requirement and Godowns are over-flooded with Wheat.</p>

    <span class="titlebold2">Climate requirement </span>
    <p class="para">
        Wheat crop has wide adaptability. It can be grown not only in the tropical and sub-tropical
        zones, but also in the temperate zone and the cold tracts of the far north ,beyond
        even the 60 degree north altitude . Wheat can tolerate severe cold and snow and
        resume growth with the setting in of warm weather in spring .It can be cultivated
        from sea level to as high as 3300 meters.</p>
    <p class="para">
        The best wheat are produced in areas favoured with cool, moist weather during the
        major portion of the growing period followed by dry, warm weather to enable the
        grain to ripen properly. The optimum temperature range for ideal germination of
        wheat seed is 20-25 C though the seeds can germinate in the temperature range 3.5
        to 35 c. Rains just after sowing hamper germination and encourage seedling blight.
        Areas with a warm and damp climate are not suited for wheat growing.</p>
    <p class="para">
        During the heading and flowering stages, excessively high or low temperatures and
        drought are harmful to wheat. Cloudy weather, with high humidity and low temperatures
        is conducive for rust attack. Wheat plant requires about 14-15 c optimum average
        temperature at the time of ripening . The temperature conditions at the time of
        grain filling and development are very crucial for yield. Temperatures above 250c
        during this period tend to depress grain weight. When temperatures are high, too
        much energy I lost through the process of transpiration by the plants and the reduced
        residual energy results in poorer grain formation and lower yields. Wheat is mainly
        a rabi (winter) season crop in India.</p>
    <span class="titlebold2">Soil </span>
    <p class="para">
        Wheat is grown in a variety of soils of India. Soils with a clay loam or loam texture,
        good structure and moderate water holding capacity are ideal for wheat cultivation.
        Care should be taken to avoid very porous and excessively drained oils. Soil should
        be neutral in its reaction. Heavy soil with good drainage are suitable for wheat
        cultivation under dry conditions. These soils absorb and retain rain water well.
        Heavy soils with poor structure and poor drainage are not suitable as wheat is sensitive
        to water logging. Wheat can be successfully grown on lighter soils provided their
        water and nutrient holding capacity are improved.</p>
    <span class="titlebold2">Fertilizer management </span>
    <p class="para">
        The time and placement of fertilizer is another area where significant progress
        was made. It was demonstrated that 120 kg nitrogen, 60 kg phosphorus and 30 kg potash
        per hectare were required for optimum productivity. The N was to be applied in two
        split doses of 60 kg as basal and the remaining 60 kg at first irrigation and full
        phosphorus and potash to be applied as basal. Recently, the new wheat varieties
        have responded up to 180 kg N/ha with optima dose around 150 kg/ha. In the Indo-Gangetic
        plains, application of zinc @ 25kg/ha in rice-wheat system was found to increase
        the yield substantially. Recently, the use of sulphur has been found beneficial
        for enhancing the productivity as well as the grain protein content of wheat. Response
        to Mn (pockets in the Indo-Gangetic plains) and boron (eastern and far eastern region)
        has also been realized.</p>
    <span class="titlebold2">Nutrient management </span>
    <p class="para">
        With intensive agriculture, deficiency of essential nutrients has also become wide
        spread. The work conducted under the All India Coordinated Research Project on Micronutrient
        in Crops and Soils, has shown wide spread deficiency of zinc in soils in India.
        At the national level, the deficiency level in micro nutrients is Zn: 46 %, B: 17
        %, Mo: 12 %, Fe: 11 % and Cu: 5%. The deficiency of sulphur has also been reported
        across a wide range of soils (38%).The yield response to sulphur has been obtained
        in more than 40 crops including cereal, millets, oilseeds and pulses etc. To realize
        the potential yield, strategies may include</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Site specific nutrient management for targeted yields</li>
        <li>Integration of crop residues, bio fertilizers etc with inorganic fertilization</li>
        <li>Tillage techniques like FIRBS for increasing nutrient use efficiencies</li>
        <li>Remote sensing for efficient Nutrient management</li>
        <li>Nutrient management, straw quality vis-à-vis human and animal health</li>

    <p class="para">
        Maize (Zea mays L) is one of the most versatile emerging crops having wider adaptability
        under varied agro-climatic conditions. Globally, maize is known as queen of cereals
        because it has the highest genetic yield potential among the cereals. It is cultivated
        on nearly 150 m ha in about 160 countries having wider diversity of soil, climate,
        biodiversity and management practices that contributes 36 % (782 m t) in the global
        grain production. The United States of America (USA) is the largest producer of
        maize contributes nearly 35 % of the total production in the world and maize is
        the driver of the US economy. The USA has the highest productivity (> 9.6 t ha-1
            ) which is double than the global average (4.92 t ha-1). Whereas, the average productivity
            in India is 2.43 t ha-1</p>
            <p class="para">
            In India, maize is the third most important food crops after rice and wheat. According
            to advance estimate its production is likely to be 22.23 M Tonnes (2012-13) mainly
            during Kharif season which covers 80% area. Maize in India, contributes nearly 9
            % in the national food basket. In addition to staple food for human beimg
        g and quality
        feed for animals, maize serves as a basic raw material as an ingredient to thousands
        of industrial products that includes starch, oil, protein, alcoholic beverages,
        food sweeteners, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, film, textile, gum, package and paper
        industries etc.

    <p class="para">
        The maize is cultivated throughout the year in all states of the country for various
        purposes including grain, fodder, green cobs, sweet corn, baby corn, pop corn in
        peri-urban areas. The predominant maize growing states that contributes more than
        80 % of the total maize production are Andhra Pradesh (20.9 %), Karnataka (16.5

            Madhya Pradesh (5.7 %), Himachal Pradesh (4.4 %). Apart from these states maize
        is also grown in Jammu and Kashmir and North-Eastern states. Hence, the maize has
        emerged as important crop in the non-traditional regions i.e. peninsular India as
        the state like Andhra Pradesh which ranks 5th in area (0.79 m ha) has recorded the
        highest production (4.14 m t) and productivity (5.26 t ha-1 ) in the country although
        the productivity in some of the districts of Andhra Pradesh is more or equal to
        the USA.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
        Maize can be grown successfully in variety of soils ranging from loamy sand to clay
        loam. However, soils with good organic matter content having high water holding
        capacity with neutral pH are considered good for higher productivity. Being a sensitive
        crop to moisture stress particularly excess soil moisture and salinity stresses;
        it is desirable to avoid low lying fields having poor drainage and also the field
        having higher salinity. Therefore, the fields having provision of proper drainage
        should be selected for cultivation of maize.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
        All India Coordinated Research Project (AICRP) on maize was launched in 1957 with
        the objective to develop and disseminate genetically superior cultivars and production/protection
        technologies. AICRP organizes interdisciplinary, interinstitutional, co-operative
        and systematic testing of newly developed cultivars of both public and private sectors
        for different agro-climatic zones of the country. The project resulted in refining
        efforts in varietal improvement. Since 1961, a total number of 187 cultivars including
        single cross hybrids, composites and multiple parent crosses have been released
        nationwide. In India, maize is traditionally grown in monsoon (Kharif) season, which
        is accompanied by high temperature (&lt;35&deg; C) and rainfall. However, with the
        development of new cultivars and appropriate production technology, winter cultivation
        of maize has emerged as a viable alternative.

    <div class="crop-main-learn"> <span class="titlebold2">About Rice</span>
      <p class="para"> <span class="italic">Oryza Sativa,</span> it is believed, is associated with wet, humid climate, though it is not a tropical plant. It is probably a descendent of wild grass that was most likely cultivated in the foothills of the far Eastern Himalayas. Another school of thought believes that the rice plant may have originated in southern India, then spread to the north of the country and then onwards to China. It then arrived in Korea, the Philippines (about 2000 B. C.) and then Japan and Indonesia (about 1000 B. C.). </p>
      <p class="para">The journey of rice around the world has been slow, but once it took root it stayed and became a major agriculture and economic product for the people. In the Indian subcontinent more than a quarter of the cultivated land is given to rice (20011-12). It is a very essential part of the daily meal in the southern and eastern parts of India. In the northern and central parts of the subcontinent, where wheat  is frequently eaten, rice holds its own and is cooked daily as well as on festivals and special occasions.</p>
      <span class="titlebold2">History of Rice in India</span>
      <p class="para">India is an important centre of rice cultivation. The rice  is cultivated on the largest areas  in India. Historians believe that while the <span class="italic">indica</span> variety of rice was first domesticated in the area covering the foothills of the Eastern Himalayas (i.e. north-eastern India), stretching through Burma, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Southern China, the <span class="italic">japonica</span> variety was domesticated from wild rice in southern China which was introduced to India. Perennial wild rice still grow in Assam and Nepal. It seems to have appeared around 1400 BC in southern India after its domestication in the northern plains. It then spread to all the fertile alluvial plains watered by rivers. Some says that the word rice is derived from the Tamil word <span class="italic">arisi.</span></p>
      <span class="titlebold2">Climatic Requirements</span>
      <p class="para">In India rice is grown under widely varying conditions of altitude and climate. Rice cultivation in India extends from 8 to35ºN latitude and from sea level to as high as 3000 meters. Rice crop needs a hot and humid climate. It is best suited to regions which have high humidity, prolonged sunshine and an assured supply of water. The average temperature required throughout the life period of the crop ranges from 21 to 37º C. Maximum temp which the crop can tolerate	400C to 42 0C. </p>
      <span class="titlebold2">Nutritional value of Rice</span>
      <p class="para">Rice is a nutritional staple food which provides instant energy as its most important component is carbohydrate (starch). On the other hand, rice is poor in nitrogenous substances with average composition of these substances being only 8 per cent and fat content or lipids only negligible, i.e., 1per cent and due to this reason it is considered as a complete food for eating. Rice flour is rich in starch and is used for making various food materials. It is also used in some instances by brewers to make alcoholic malt. Likewise, rice straw mixed with other materials is used to produce porcelain, glass and pottery. Rice is also used in manufacturing of paper pulp and livestock bedding.</p>
      <p class="para">The variability of composition and characteristics of rice is really broad and depends on variety and environmental conditions under which the crop is grown. In husked rice, protein content ranges in between 7per cent to 12per cent.  The use of nitrogen fertilizers increases the percentage content of some amino acids.</p>
      <span class="titlebold2">Medicinal Value</span>
      <p class="para">The immense diversity of rice germplasm is a rich source for many rice based products and is also used for treating many health related maladies such as indigestion, diabetes, arthritis, paralysis, epilepsy and give strength to pregnant  and lactating mothers. Ancient Ayurvedic literature testify the medicinal and curative properties of different types of  rice grown in India. Medicinal rice varieties like Kanthi Banko (Chhattisgarh), Meher, Saraiphul &amp; Danwar (Orissa), Atikaya &amp; Kari Bhatta (Karnataka), are very common in India. Few varieties cultivated in restricted pockets of Kerala for their medical properties e.g. Chennellu, Kunjinellu, Erumakkari &amp;  Karuthachembavu etc.</p>
      <span class="titlebold2">Crop Production Practices </span>
      <p class="para">In India Rice is mainly grown in two types of soils i.e., (i) uplands and (ii) low lands. The method of cultivation of rice in a particular region depends largely on factors such as situation of land, type of soils, irrigation facilities, availability of labourers intensity and distribution of rainfalls. The crop of rice is grown with the following methods</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dry or Semi-dry upland cultivation
          <ul id="newbullets">
            <li>Broadcasting the seed</li>
            <li>Sowing the seed behind the plough or drilling</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Wet or lowland cultivation
          <ul id="newbullets_2">
            <li>Transplanting in puddled fields.</li>
            <li>Broadcasting sprouted seeds in puddled fields.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span class="titlebold2">Selection of Seeds</span>
      <p class="para">The use of quality seeds in cultivation of rice is an important factor to get better crop yield. Therefore, proper care has to be taken in selecting seeds of the best quality. Much of the success in raising the healthy seedlings depends on the quality of seed. Seeds intended for sowing should satisfy the following requirements</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The seed should belong to the proper variety, which is proposed to be grown.</li>
        <li>The seed should be clean and free from obvious mixtures of other seeds. </li>
        <li>The seed should be mature, well developed and plump in size. </li>
        <li>The seed should be free from obvious signs of age or bad storage.</li>
        <li>The seed should have a high germinating capacity.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="para">Before sowing the seed should be treated with fungicides which protects the seed against soil-born fungi and also give a boost to the seedlings.</p>

    <p class="para"> Pulses are consumed as Dal, which is a cheap source of plant protein. These are consumed because of body building properties having presence of various amino acids. These also have medicinal properties. By products of pulses like leaves, pod coats and bran are given to animals in the form of dry fodder. Some pulse crops like Gram, Lobia, Urdbean &amp; Moongbean are fed to animals as green fodder. Moong plants are also used as green manure which improve soil health and adds nutrient into the soil. </p>
    <p class="para">A number of pulse crops are grown in India and world. Among the crops, major ones are Gram, Pigeonpea, Lentil, Fieldpeas etc. According to history, the origin of Gram is in South West Asia – probably Afghanistan and Persia, Pigeonpea in Africa, Lentil in Turkey to South Iran and Fieldpeas in Mediterranean Region of Southern Europe and Western Asia.</p>
    <span class="titlebold2">Important Major Pulses Growing Zones / States in India</span>
    <p class="para"> Varietal Development programme of pulses got strengthened in 1967 with the initiation of All-India Co-ordinated Research Improvement Programme. Through this programme, the varieties suitable for across the country i.e. agro-climatic zones: Northern Hills Zone – J&amp;K, Himachal Pradesh, North West of Uttar Pradesh;  North West Plain Zone – Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat, western Uttar Pradesh; North East Plain Zone – eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, Tripura, Mizoram, Northern Odisha; Central Zone – Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Parts of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh; South Zone – Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka and southern Odisha have been developed.</p>
    <span class="titlebold2">Climatic Requirement</span>
    <p class="para">Pulse crops are cultivated in Kharif, Rabi and Zaid seasons of the Agricultural year. Rabi crops require mild cold climate during sowing period, during vegetative to pod development cold climate and during maturity / harvesting warm climate. Similarly, Kharif pulse crops require warm climate throughout their life from sowing to harvesting. Summer pulses are habitants of warm climate. Seed is required to pass many stages to produce seed like germination, seedling, vegetative, flowering, fruit setting, pod development and grain maturity / harvesting. </p>
    <span class="titlebold2"> Area, Production And Yield Of Major Pulse Crops Growing States In India </span>
    <p class="para"> There was 239 lakh ha area in India at triennium ending 2010-11, which was mainly contributed by Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh. From this area, 158 lakh tonnes production of pulse was received. The major contributors of this production were Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh. During this period, productivity of pulses was recorded as 661 kg / ha with highest in Punjab (905 kg/ha), Haryana (891), Bihar (839), Uttar Pradesh (823) and West Bengal (811).</p>

    a.innerHTML=`   <div class="crop-main-learn"> <span class="titlebold2">About Jute</span>
    <p class="para"> Jute is an important natural fibre crop in India next to cotton. In trade and industry, jute and mesta crop together known as raw jute as their uses are almost same. Raw jute plays an important role in the country’s economy. Raw jute was originally considered as a source of raw material for packaging industries only. But it has now emerged as a versatile raw material for diverse applications, such as, textile industries, paper industries, building and automotive industries, use as soil saver, use as decorative and furnishing materials, etc. Raw jute being bio-degradable and annually renewable source, it is considered as an environment-friendly crop and it helps in the maintenance of the environment and ecological balance. Further attraction of Jute lies in its easy availability, inexhaustible quantity at a comparatively cheaper rate. Moreover, it can easily be blended with other natural and manmade fibres. </p>
    <p class="para">Although Jute acreage has stabilized around 8 lakh hectares in the country, jute
      productivity has more than doubled to 22.12 q/ha in 2010-11 since partition of the country
      from 11 qtl per ha and the total production of raw jute in the country is about 10.58 million
      bales of 180 kg each. This has happened due to development of short duration high yielding
      varieties as well as other production technologies by ICAR including fertilizer management,
      weed management, farm machineries and pest management. CRIJAF (ICAR) has developed
      around 15 high yielding varieties of jute and allied fibres. Production and distribution of
      certified seed of newly released varieties are the need of the hour for further improvement
      in productivity. ICAR has taken the initiatives for production of quality seed of newly
      released varieties of jute in its farms which may increase the yield by at least 20-30%. Five
      most important issues namely, improvement in productivity, quality improvement, retting
      of jute, farm machineries and quality seed production are addressed by the ICAR through
      various on-going projects, which have contributed to the present level of production with
      adequate support from the Jute Technology Mission and Directorate of Jute Development
      of the Ministry of Agriculture. </p>
    <p class="para">With its insignificant coverage of total cultivated area, it plays a predominant role in the country’s economy by generating employment, earning foreign exchange, solving many of the socio-economic problems, etc. In earlier years, Jute was considered as a Golden Fibre but there after it had to pass through different critical situation.  The main problem came in the way with the introduction of synthetic fibre by the end of sixties/early seventies. After the development of diversified product of jute fibre and due to growing concern about the environment pollution, the importance of jute has again revived. </p>
    <span class="titlebold2">Important regions/ zones for Jute cultivation in India</span>
    <p class="para"> Jute cultivation is mainly concentrated in the eastern and north eastern India while that of mesta cultivation is spread almost throughout the country.  The crop can be grown in low, medium and high land situation, both moisture stress and water stagnating condition.  White Jute can be grown comparatively in low land situation while that of Tossa Jute prefers medium and high land situation.  Mesta is grown in almost all over the country. It being a hardy crop and can tolerate moisture stress; its cultivation is spread in different agro-climatic situations unlike jute which is concentrated only in eastern and north eastern States. In a major part of Jute area, particularly in North Bengal, Bihar and North-Eastern States, the soil is acidic in nature. However, the Jute crop is growing in these areas in existing situation adjusting the crop sequence. </p>

    <p class="para"> Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) family Gramineae (Poaceae) is widely grown crop in India.  It provides employment to over a million people directly or indirectly besides contributing significantly to the national exchequer. Sugarcane growing countries of the world lay between the latitude 36.7° north and 31.0° south of the equator extending from tropical to subtropical zones. Sugar cane originated in New Guinea where it has been known for thousands of years. Sugar cane plants spread along human migration routes to Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Here it cross-bred with some wild sugar cane relatives to produce the commercial sugar cane we know today.</p>
    <p class="para">Cultivation of sugarcane in India dates back to the Vedic period. The earliest mention of sugarcane cultivation is found in Indian writings of the period 1400 to 1000 B.C. It is now widely accepted that India is the original home of Saccharum species. Saccharum barberi and Polynesian group of island especially New Guinea is the centre of origin of S. officinarum. It belongs to family Gramineae (Poaceae), class monocotyledons and order glumaceae sub family panicoidae, tribe Andripogoneae and sub tribe saccharininea. The cultivated canes belong to two main groups: (a) thin, hardy north Indian types S.barberi and S.Sinense and (b) thick, juicy noble canes Saccharum officinarum. Highly prized cane is S. officinarum. </p>
    <span class="titlebold2">Important regions/ zones for sugarcane cultivation in India</span>
    <p class="para"> Broadly there are two distinct agro-climatic regions of sugarcane cultivation in India, viz., tropical and subtropical. However, five agro-climatic zones have been identified mainly for the purpose of varietal development. They are (i)North Western Zone (ii) North Central Zone (iii) North Eastern Zone (iv) Peninsular Zone (v) Coastal Zone.</p>
    <p class="para">Tropical region Shared about 45% and 55% of the total sugarcane area and production in the country, respectively along with the average productivity of 77 t/ha (2011-12). Sub-tropical region accounted for about 55% and 45% of total area and production  of sugarcane  with an average productivity about 63 t/ha (2011-12) </p>
    <span class="titlebold2">Tropical Sugarcane region</span>
    <p class="para">The tropical sugarcane region consists of sugarcane agro climatic zone 4 (peninsular zone) and 5(Coastal zone) which includes the states of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Goa, Pondicherry and Kerala. </p>
    <p class="para"><strong>Sub-tropical sugarcane region:</strong> Around 55 per cent of total cane area in the country is in the sub-tropics. U.P, Bihar, Haryana and Punjab comes under this region.</p>
    <p class="para"><strong>Crop distribution:</strong> Sugarcane growing countries of the world  are lying between the latitude 36.70 north and 31.00 south of the equator extending from tropical to sub-tropical zones. In India sugarcane is cultivated all over the country from latitude 80 N to 330 N, except cold hilly areas like Kashmir valley, Himachal Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh. </p>
    <span class="titlebold2">Climatic requirement</span>
    <p class="para"><strong>Temperature for different critical stages of sugarcane:</strong> The different critical stages are germination, tillering, early growth, active growth and elongation. Optimum temperature for sprouting (germination) of stem cuttings is 32° to 38°c. It slows down below 25°, reaches plateau between 30°-34°. Temperatures above 38° reduce the rate of photosynthesis and increase respiration. For ripening, however, relatively low temperatures in the range of 12° to 14° are desirable. </p>
    <span class="titlebold2">Reduction in yield of sugarcane due to rise in temperature</span>
    <p class="para">The sugarcane productivity and juice quality are profoundly influenced by weather conditions prevailing during the various crop-growth sub-periods. Sugar recovery is highest when the weather is dry with low humidity; bright sunshine hours, cooler nights with wide diurnal variations and very little rainfall during ripening period. These conditions favour high sugar accumulation. The climatic conditions like very high temperature or very low temperature deteriorate the juice quality and thus affecting the sugar quality. Favourable climate like warm and humid climate favour the insect pests and diseases, which cause much damage to the quality and yield of its juice and finally sucrose contents. </p>
